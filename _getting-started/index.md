## Components

- [OpenSearch Dashboards](../_dashboards/index.md)
- [Data Prepper](../_data-prepper/index.md)
- [Clients]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/clients/): Language APIs that let you communicate with OpenSearch in several popular programming languages.

## Use cases

OpenSearch supports a variety of use cases, for example:

- [Observability]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/observing-your-data/): Visualize data-driven events by using Piped Processing Language (PPL) to explore, discover, and query data stored in OpenSearch.
- [Search]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/): Choose the best search method for your application, from regular lexical search to conversational search powered by machine learning (ML).
- [Machine learning]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/ml-commons-plugin/): Integrate ML models into your OpenSearch application.
- [Security analytics]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/security-analytics/): Investigate, detect, analyze, and respond to security threats that can jeopardize organizational success and online operations.
